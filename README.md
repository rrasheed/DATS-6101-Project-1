## Overview
This project explores an education data set conatining 2 different files. The first dataset contains revenues and expenditures pertaining to education for every state in America. The second dataset loked at each school district and in America and showed their average test scores for Mathematics and Reading for 4th and 8th grade. 

## Objective
This project was assigned for our group to fully understand what steps should be taken for a proper exploratory data analysis(EDA). We merged the two data sets together to create a fianl dataframe that conatined the Total Revenue, Total Expenditure, and Average Test Scores for each state for the past 10 years. Our group focused on the relationship between the money a state spends on education and the average math test scores.
